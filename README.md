# Ice CTF 2016
A discussion/solution repo for Ice CTF 2016

## How to use
* For each problem, no matter how easy or hard it is, a issue needs to be created for it.
* For the first simple problems, the issues will just simply say how they were solved.
* For the harder ones, explanations on how they were solved should be written.
* The user that is actively working on the problem should self-assign himself the issue.
* Tagging other users for help/discussion encouraged!
* If pushing files to the repo, make sure to add the files related to problem X into a folder called X
* Don't care if English or Icelandic, I'm just used to using English on GitHub. Sue me.
