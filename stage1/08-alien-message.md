We found this [suspicous image](https://play.icec.tf/problem-static/alien_message_b84f283848b7f34fd4c7529186e66e120b0a374c9d0f2a225b0a7a215716afb5.png) online and it looked like it had been planted there by an alien life form. Can you see if you can figure out what they're trying to tell us?

## Write-up

It's again just a substituion cipher, this one is actually the first version of the alien language in Futurama. Solving the substituion gives us the flag:

`ICECTF{GOOD_N3WZ_3VERYON3_1_L1K3_FU7UR4MA_4ND_TH3IR_4MAZ1NG_3AS7ER_39G5}`
