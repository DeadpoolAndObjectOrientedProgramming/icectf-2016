I can assure you that the flag was on [this website](http://time-traveler.icec.tf/) at some point in time. 

## Write-up

The name is definitely a hint. It's simple to look up pages on [the wayback machine](https://archive.org/web/) to see how they looked back at some point in time.
Looking up this website gives us [this result](https://web.archive.org/web/20160601212948/http://time-traveler.icec.tf/), or the flag `IceCTF{Th3y'11_n3v4r_f1|\|d_m4h_fl3g_1n_th3_p45t}`
